There’s no right way to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/), but there are a lot of ways to use it inefficiently. As a life-long learner, I had the need to document my ~~best~~ opinionated practices  and conventions. 


##  commit and release note


use det : operator before and after the keyword. : fish : ( 🐟 ) without spaces between : and fish

You can pull up the emoji keyboard by hitting:
* MacOS: <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd>
* Windows10: <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd>

## Contributing
As I use this for my own projects, I know this might not be the perfect approach for you. If you have any ideas, just open an issue and tell me what you think :speech_balloon:.

You'll need the current version of [OmnniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/) and several free [IBM Plex Sans fonts](https://github.com/IBM/plex) (e.g. light, medium and semiBold.). The current [Apple Color Palette .clr file](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/apple-colorpalette-solarized) is available in the ``src`` directory.

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/yourname/yourproject/fork>)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/whatEver`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some whatEver'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/whatEver`)
5. Create a new Pull Request :grin:
