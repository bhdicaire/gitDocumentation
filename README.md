## Contributing
As I use this for my own projects, I know this might not be the perfect approach for you. If you have any ideas, just open an issue and tell me what you think :speech_balloon:.

You'll need the current version of [OmnniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/) and several free [IBM Plex Sans fonts](https://github.com/IBM/plex) (e.g. light, medium and semiBold.). The current [Apple Color Palette .clr file](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/apple-colorpalette-solarized) is available in the ``src`` directory.

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/yourname/yourproject/fork>)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/whatEver`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some whatEver'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/whatEver`)
5. Create a new Pull Request :grin:
